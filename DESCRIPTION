Title: Applied Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Functions
Description: Provides functions that allow for convenient working with vector space models of semantics/distributional semantic models/word embeddings. 
	Originally built for LSA models (hence the name), but can be used for all such vector-based models. 
	For actually building a vector semantic space, use the package 'lsa' or other specialized software. 
	Downloadable semantic spaces can be found at <https://sites.google.com/site/fritzgntr/software-resources>.
