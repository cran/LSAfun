[version 0.4] ChangeLog

(1) Added asymmetric similarity functions
    (1.1) The asym() function, containing various functions for computing 
	      "category-inclusion" (hypernymy) similarities, and the SIM function
		  proposed by Kintsch (2014)
	(1.1) Similarity-in-context function conSIM() according to Kintsch (2014)

(2) Added function for distances between vectors with the distance() function, 
    including the Euclidean Distance and City Block Distance
	
(3) Added measures for plausibility/ semantic transparency of vectors 
    with the plausibility() function
	
(4) Extended the compose() function by including method="CConv" and method="Dilation"
	
	

[version 0.3.2] ChangeLog

(1) Made MultipleChoice() more adaptive if one answer alternative cannot be found

(2) Added cex parameter for plot_wordlist and plot_neighbors



[version 0.3.1] ChangeLog

(1) Added datasets: syntest, oldbooks, priming

(2) Changed function names: neighbours() to neighbors()
                            plot_neighbours() to plot_neighbors()

(3) Updates for plot_neighbors and plot_wordlist
	(3.1) Changed a bug in plot_neighbors and plot_wordlist that always plotted 
		  two- as well as three-dimensional plots
	(3.2) plot_neighbors and plot_wordlist now also give the coordinates for
		  the words in the plot as a data frame (default output)

		  
		  
[version 0.3] ChangeLog

(1) Modifications for breakdown(), can now deal with more special characters  

(2) Added the argument "method" and the argument "dims" to plot_neighbours

(3) Added the function plot_wordlist



[version 0.2] ChangeLog

(1) Added function normalize()
	(1.1) Enabled Argument norm for compose()
	(1.2) Enabled Argument norm for Predication()
	(1.3) Updated Help file for compose() and Predication()


(2) Calling the function Cosine() for words that are not in rownames(tvectors) now returns NA instead of the warning message as value
	(2.1) Affects the functions Cosine(), compose(), neighbours()

(3) For functions using the argument tvectors, the warning message "tvectors must be a matrix!" was replaced by an error message

(4) Fixed a bug in plot_neighbours() where the function sometimes did not find the neighbours in rownames(tvectors) due to "breakdown" issues

(5) Major updates for plot_neighbours() - prettier plots
	(5.1) Added parameter "alpha" (luminance for start.lines and connect.lines, with option "shade)
	(5.2) Added parameter "col" (with additional option "rainbow" for rainbow colors depending on cosine between two words)
    (5.3) Added option "all" for "connect.lines" (will automatically use alpha="shade")
	(5.4) Updated Help file for plot_neighbours()
