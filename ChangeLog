[version 0.8.1] ChangeLog

(1) Added the function centroid_analysis()



[version 0.7.1] ChangeLog

(1) Added the functions analogy() and SND()

(2) Updates to functions that compute a document/sentence vector from the included word vectors:
	costring(), multicostring(), MultipleChoice(), multidocs()
	(2.1) Added a "method" option to choose how document/sentence vectors are computed from the word vectors: 
			method="Add" for vector additon, or method="Multiply" for element-wise multiplication
	(2.2) Added a "stopword" option to specify a character vector of words that should not 
			be used to compute the document/sentence vector
			
(3) Updates to the MultipleChoice() function
	(3.1) Added a "all.results" option to determine the output value of the function:
			"all.results=FALSE" (default): As in the previous versions, only returns the closest answer option
			"all.results=TRUE": returns a named numeric vector, where the names are the different answer options,
								and the numeric values their respective cosine similarity to the question, 
								sorted by decreasing similarity
	(3.2) Added the third option method="Analogy" beyond method="Add" and method="Multiply" inherited from costring()



[version 0.6.3] ChangeLog

(1) Removed the breakdown() function - take care that your queries match the entries of your semantic spaces!



[version 0.6.2] ChangeLog

(1) Updated the costring() and multicostring() functions 
	(1.1) Now includes a remove.punctuation option (default: remove.punctuation=TRUE)
			In the previous version, a sentence such as "the lion, the tiger, and the gazelle" would
			be split into words such as "lion," or "tiger," instead of "lion" and "tiger", which
			would then typically not be found in the semantic space
	(1.2) Now includes a split option (default: split=" ") that allows users to define the character
			by which the document/sentence should be split into individual words
	(1.3) Now already returns a Note when *some* words cannot be found in the semantic space, instead of
			just a warning when *all* words cannot be found


[version 0.6.1] ChangeLog

(1) Minor bug-fix



[version 0.6] ChangeLog

(1) Added the functions multidocs() and plot_doclist()

(2) Updated the functions plot_neighbors and plot_wordlists
    (2.1) The luminance gradient alpha and the color of connect.lines and start.lines can
	        now be changed independently from one another
	(2.2) Replaced alpha="shade" with alpha="graded". However, alpha="shade" still works and is 
	      automatically converted to alpha="graded".
	(2.3) Added the parameter alpha.grade (default alpha.grade = 1) which allows to scale 
	        the luminance of all connect.lines and start.lines by a certain factor when alpha="graded"
	(2.4) Added more color palette options for the col parameter (heat.colors, terrain.colors,
	        topo.colors, cm.colors)
	(2.5) It is now also possible to include any customized color palette using the col parameter
	(2.6) Added the parameter legend (default legend=T) to illustrate the color scheme of the connect.lines 
	(2.7) Added the parameter size to control the size of the plots
	(2.8) Changed the default parameters to connect.lines="all" and col="rainbow"
	(2.9) Fixed a bug where connect.lines would not show the correct number of lines when set to a numerical value
	    

		
[version 0.5.3] ChangeLog

(1) Fixed a bug where the distance() function returned NULL values for the "euclidean" option

(2) Updated the Example in the documentation for the MultipleChoice() function so that it no
    longer produces Warnings

(3) Updated the link to the website containing semantic spaces in the package description
	

	
[version 0.5.2] ChangeLog

(1) All functions that want to use character vectors now automatically try to convert
    the input to characters using as.character(). They inform the user with the message
	"Note: x converted to character" when doing so.

	

[version 0.5.1] ChangeLog

(1) All functions relying on a specification of a tvectors argument can now not
    only deal with "matrix" objects as input for tvectors, but also with "data.frame" 
	or "textmatrix" objects
	
	

[version 0.5] ChangeLog

(1) Set breakdown=FALSE as default for all functions (instead of breakdown=TRUE)

(2) Added the function pairwise()

(3) Added a new CITATION file, citing the LSAfun journal article



[version 0.4.1] ChangeLog

(1) Corrected a wrong formula that caused asym() to give wrong values for
    method="clarkede" and method ="invcl"

[version 0.4] ChangeLog

(1) Added asymmetric similarity functions
    (1.1) The asym() function, containing various functions for computing 
	      "category-inclusion" (hypernymy) similarities, and the SIM function
		  proposed by Kintsch (2014)
	(1.1) Similarity-in-context function conSIM() according to Kintsch (2014)

(2) Added function for distances between vectors with the distance() function, 
    including the Euclidean Distance and City Block Distance
	
(3) Added measures for plausibility/ semantic transparency of vectors 
    with the plausibility() function
	
(4) Extended the compose() function by including method="CConv" and method="Dilation"
	
	

[version 0.3.2] ChangeLog

(1) Made MultipleChoice() more adaptive if one answer alternative cannot be found

(2) Added cex parameter for plot_wordlist() and plot_neighbors()



[version 0.3.1] ChangeLog

(1) Added datasets: syntest, oldbooks, priming

(2) Changed function names: neighbours() to neighbors()
                            plot_neighbours() to plot_neighbors()

(3) Updates for plot_neighbors() and plot_wordlist()
	(3.1) Changed a bug in plot_neighbors() and plot_wordlist() that always plotted 
		  two- as well as three-dimensional plots
	(3.2) plot_neighbors() and plot_wordlist() now also give the coordinates for
		  the words in the plot as a data frame (default output)

		  
		  
[version 0.3] ChangeLog

(1) Modifications for breakdown(), can now deal with more special characters  

(2) Added the argument "method" and the argument "dims" to plot_neighbours()

(3) Added the function plot_wordlist()



[version 0.2] ChangeLog

(1) Added function normalize()
	(1.1) Enabled Argument norm for compose()
	(1.2) Enabled Argument norm for Predication()
	(1.3) Updated Help file for compose() and Predication()


(2) Calling the function Cosine() for words that are not in rownames(tvectors) now returns NA instead of the warning message as value
	(2.1) Affects the functions Cosine(), compose(), neighbours()

(3) For functions using the argument tvectors, the warning message "tvectors must be a matrix!" was replaced by an error message

(4) Fixed a bug in plot_neighbours() where the function sometimes did not find the neighbours in rownames(tvectors) due to "breakdown" issues

(5) Major updates for plot_neighbours() - prettier plots
	(5.1) Added parameter "alpha" (luminance for start.lines and connect.lines, with option "shade)
	(5.2) Added parameter "col" (with additional option "rainbow" for rainbow colors depending on cosine between two words)
    (5.3) Added option "all" for "connect.lines" (will automatically use alpha="shade")
	(5.4) Updated Help file for plot_neighbours()
